  <!--Depending on what it is you want to make or do, your choice might already be made up for you.



 To build a website or webapp, for example, you should learn HTML and CSS, along with JavaScript and perhaps PHP for interactivity.


Java - you'll be able to access/manipulate the most important computer parts like the filesystem, graphics, and sound for any fairly sophisticated and modern program—that can run on any operating system.
Java programming will be able to create dynamic web applications, and be able continue into our Android track.
Java. May have background in mathematics or quantitative analysis.
Android is used in everything from phones to tablets to watches, and companies hiring Android developers range from small startups to giant enterprises.

Whether you’re an aspiring freelancer, a design-savvy front-end developer, or a budding UI/UX designer, this course is a launching point for anyone interested in designing beautiful, memorable web experiences.

<p>The first programming language you learn will likely be the hardest to learn. Picking something small and fun makes this less of a challenge and more of an adventure. It doesn't really matter where you start as long as you keep going—keep writing code, keep reading code. Don't forget to test it either. Once you have one language you're happy with, picking up a new language is less of a feat, and you'll pick up new skills on the way.</p>
